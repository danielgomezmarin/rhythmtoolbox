# Rhythm Toolbox
This repository contains python scripts used to study rhythm in symbolic format. It contains useful tools for monophonic as well as polyphonic pattern analysis. Although it is fine tuned for polyphonic drum patterns, all the descriptors can be adapted for other types of data streams. The descriptors included are derived from scientific sources that have studied rhythm from different perspectives. All the authors and papers related to the descriptors are properly cited. If this repository is useful for you or your research please cite "Drum rhythm spaces: From polyphonic similarity to generative maps" which you can find here https://doi.org/10.1080/09298215.2020.1806887. 

This version (Jan 2023) has code improvements, revisions of some algorithms and also new algorithms of new descriptors that have emerged since 2018 and have been adapted both for monophonic and polyphonic scenarios. If you want to go to the older version of the repo (Nov 2018) make git checkout 6acdb69a60153d0874da87560df3d7c62765e27a.
